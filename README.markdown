# RssDigesterWithCouchbase #

This is another one of my rss code samples.  This one however is an experiment using couchbase and the couchbase java client. 
I took one of my previous code samples ( <https://github.com/melanio/RssDigesterWithSpring/> ) and replaced the MYSQL database with couchbase.

Also, working with couchbase has been a pleasurable experience.
